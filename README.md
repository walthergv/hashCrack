# hashCrack
This is a simple hash cracker that can identify and crack different types of hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512, etc.) using a wordlist. It takes the hash and wordlist as input, then it matches the hash with words in the list and returns the original word if it finds a match.
